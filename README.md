# WordLove
A simple vocabulary-learning app

WordLove is a vocabulary-learning app that allows users to search for words and phrases in other languages (currently supports Spanish, German, Japanese, and Chinese) and save the results of their choice to customizable vocabulary lists.

The saved vocabulary can be assigned a difficulty (easy, medium, or hard), user-created definitions, and notes to assist the user in memorizing the words based on their learning needs and style. The difficulty can be easily updated with the click of a button, allowing the user to dynamically update their lists depending on where they are in the learning process.

WordLove also offers a simple flashcard functionality so users can practice their customized lists.
